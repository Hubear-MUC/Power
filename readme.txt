Power 1.0
---------

This program is not intended to control electrical power inside the circuits of the computer as it could be considered by the name.

Instead it calculates the power to 2 (square) to a given number.


1  double a,b;
2
3  main()
4  {
5    b=a*a;
6  }


The result has to be examined with a debugger.

First set a breakpoint at the line 4 or 5, another one to line 6.

Run the program.

When the program stops, set the value to which the power should be calculated into variable a.

Continue the program.

Then examine the result in variable b.

Continue the program to let it terminate.
