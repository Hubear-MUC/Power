Power 4.0
---------

The power of a number is calculated by a given exponent.

Also for this program it was about time to implement a version with data entry via arguments at invocation.

The program is to be invoked the following way:

  ./power number exponent

For example

  ./power 5 2

to calculate 5^2 which is 25 as result.

The result is shown in the terminal.


Changes:
--------

Version 4.0:

Implementing the entry of number and exponent by arguments at invoking.
This should make the usage of the program more comfortable.


Version 3.0

Implementation of user interaction so no debugger is necessary anymore when just working with the program.


Version 2.1

Redesign of the code to make it (a lot) more readable and maintainable.


Version 2.0

Added the possibility to calculate arbitrary powers to numbers;
Not only sqare- powers.


Version 1.0

Initial version.
